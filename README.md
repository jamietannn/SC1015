# SC1015 DSAI Project: Movie Recommendation
## Our motivation:
- In today’s digital age, streaming platforms are everywhere and user engagement is key, which leads to a growing necessity for these platforms to differentiate themselves.
- Hence, a strong recommendation system is pivotal in keeping users engaged and could not only retain existing users but can also attract more users by leveraging their individual preferences and interests.
