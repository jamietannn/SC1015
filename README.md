# SC1015 DSAI Project: Movie Recommendation
## Our motivation:
- In today’s digital age, streaming platforms are everywhere and user engagement is key, which leads to a growing necessity for these platforms to differentiate themselves.
- Hence, a strong recommendation system is pivotal in keeping users engaged and could not only retain existing users but can also attract more users by leveraging their individual preferences and interests.

## Project Goal:
- This project's objective is to develop a movie recommendation system tailored to individual users, providing personalised movie suggestions based on their past movie preferences to keep them engaged with the platform.

## Data used:
We used the [TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv) from Kaggle, which consists metadata of about 5000 movies. We merged the movies and credits into one dataset, cleaned and processed it for Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning.

# Overview of Data Science Pipeline:
### 1. Data collection:

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
### 3. EDA & Visualization:
### 4. Content Based Filtering:
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Cosine Similarity
### 5. Clustering with Collaborative Filtering:
- Finding optimum number of clusters: Elbow Curve % Silhouette Method
- Principal Component Analysis
- Clustering with KMeans
- Cosine Similarity
### 6. Key Insights & Recommendations:
Analysis:
- Clustering with collaborative filtering is better as it increases personalisation and reduces computational complexity
Streaming platforms should:
- Focus on increasing user engagement through a more personalised experience
- Regularly update recommendation models with new data for continuous learning and adaptation
